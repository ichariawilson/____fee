    <h2>Fee - Application Management</h2>
    <p>
        This is a <bold>sample</bold> web client that uses the Webhooks API to show you all applications that reached the "paid" status. This is accomplished by creating a Webhook
        that will be called by Fee core when the application reached this "paid" status. If not created you can create this webhook going to <a asp-page="RegisterWebhook">webhook registration</a>.
    </p>
    @if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        <a class="btn-primary btn" href="@Url.Action("SignIn", "Account")">Login</a>
        <p>Why I need to login? You only need to login <bold>to setup a new webhook</bold>.</p>
    }
